/**
 * @title The Pool contract
 * @author Brendan Asselstine
 * @notice This contract allows users to pool deposits into Compound and win the accrued interest in periodic draws.
 * Funds are immediately deposited and withdrawn from the Compound cToken contract.
 * Draws go through three stages: open, committed and rewarded in that order.
 * Only one draw is ever in the open stage.  Users deposits are always added to the open draw.  Funds in the open Draw are that user's open balance.
 * When a Draw is committed, the funds in it are moved to a user's committed total and the total committed balance of all users is updated.
 * When a Draw is rewarded, the gross winnings are the accrued interest since the last reward (if any).  A winner is selected with their chances being
 * proportional to their committed balance vs the total committed balance of all users.
 *
 *
 * With the above in mind, there is always an open draw and possibly a committed draw.  The progression is:
 *
 * Step 1: Draw 1 Open
 * Step 2: Draw 2 Open | Draw 1 Committed
 * Step 3: Draw 3 Open | Draw 2 Committed | Draw 1 Rewarded
 * Step 4: Draw 4 Open | Draw 3 Committed | Draw 2 Rewarded
 * Step 5: Draw 5 Open | Draw 4 Committed | Draw 3 Rewarded
 * Step X: ...
